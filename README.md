**A quick and simple repo to practice version control.**

All GIT repositories have one branch that is the overall _main_ branch. That is to say, it is not necessarily the development branch - it is the final branch where perfect, tested code lives. If this is a website, the _main_ branch is where the current version of the website lives. It is the one being shown to the world.

### Development Branches

When you work on code, you might make mistakes or get interrupted. You might also have interesting ideas that break the structure and usability of the main code. We should _never_ develop on the `main` branch of a repository. That is a safe space. We should _always_ create an "alternate timeline" for our repository that is where we make changes. **Note:** you can have as many of these alternate timelines as you want but merging them back together can be really troublesome and confusing.

#### New Branch

To make a new branch, there is the `branch` command.
