# Git and GitHub

##### ICS4U - Mr. Brash üêøÔ∏è

**A quick and simple repo to practice version control.**

All GIT repositories have one branch that is the overall _main_ branch. If this were a website, the _main_ branch is where the current version of the website lives - it is the one being shown to the world.

## Your Task

1. You will be cloning this repository to your local machine. 
  - Grab the URL from your browser window _**or**_ from the `Code` button at the top-right.
  - In the terminal, navigate to the folder when you want to place this repo (it will make its own folder)
  - Type:  `git clone <the URL>`  where you paste the URL to this repo

2. By default you will not have a `dev` branch - you'll only have `main`.
   - Make a new branch called `dev`
   - Switch to the `dev` branch and continue the task
  
3. Make a script file named `script.js` and place the following header block comment at the top and put your name next to `Author`:
   ```JS
   /**
    * ICS4 - Mr. Brash üêøÔ∏è
    * Semester 2, 2024-25
    *
    * Author:
    * Description:  Practicing version control work with Git and GitHub
    */
   ```

### Reminder: Development Branches

When you work on code, you might make mistakes or get interrupted. You might also have interesting ideas that break the structure and usability of the main code. We should _never_ develop on the `main` branch of a repository. That is a protected space. We should _always_ create an "alternate timeline" (branch) for our repository where we make changes. **Note:** you can have as many branches as you want but merging them back together can be really troublesome and confusing.

#### New Branch

You can make new branches in Git or in GitHub, but they do not automatically get connected.
